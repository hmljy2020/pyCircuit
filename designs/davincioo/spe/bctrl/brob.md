# SPE.BCTRL.BROB — Block Reorder Buffer

- Source candidate: `DAV-SPE-BCTRL-BROB-0001`
- Hardware hierarchy: **H3**, within H1 `SPE` / H2 `BCTRL`
- NDF refinement: **L2 microarchitecture**; module-specific L1 behavior links still require review.
- Recommended disposition: **leaf** (proposal, not registry approval)
- Proposed implementation path, if accepted as an independent leaf: `designs/davincioo/spe/bctrl/brob.py`
- Current design-program execution status: **not implemented**. External source evidence is recorded separately.

Block Reorder Buffer has distinct persistent ownership, arbitration, storage, or transformation responsibility suitable for a pyCircuit design leaf.

## Inputs

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| block_alloc_req | BlockAllocRequest | dynamic block allocation | proposed |
| scalar_handoff_req | HandoffReq | durable scalar record | proposed |
| engine_resolve | EngineResolve | per-engine result/fault | proposed |
| tile_publish_ack | TilePublishAck | publication obligation | proposed |
| memory_ack | BlockMemoryAck | memory obligation | proposed |
| recovery | Recovery | unpublished suffix cancellation | proposed |
| block_alloc_ack | BlockAllocAck | generation-qualified BlockKey | proposed |
| scalar_handoff_ack | HandoffAck | durable record acceptance | proposed |
| architectural_commit | ArchitecturalCommit | eligible ordered prefix | proposed |
| scalar_store_commit | ScalarStoreCommit | visible store authority | proposed |

## Outputs

| block_close | BlockCloseResult | final block completion | proposed |

Payload names in proposed rows are design pseudotypes until fields, widths and nominal identity are frozen. Queue transport is inferred by the compiler, not a requested public Queue wrapper. Clock/reset/time domain are execution context and must not be invented as ordinary payload ports.

## Owned or containing state

- per-flow block rows, durable scalar/effect journal and engine/memory obligation masks

## Required capabilities to verify

- typed compound Queue payloads
- atomic input/state/output rule semantics
- bounded Table/Array lowering with generation-qualified identity
- multi-output all-or-none publication and independent backpressure
- inferred persistent prepare/publish/compensate transaction lowering

These are requirements, not proof that the current framework is missing each one. First test the current revision; a demonstrated gap becomes a generic framework/primitive issue and regression before a dependent design PR.

## Behavioral acceptance

- All declared/proposed Queue outputs remain stable under backpressure and preserve full identity/generation.
- Stale, duplicate, wrong-flow, and post-recovery responses cause no mutation.
- gfsim and generated C++/Verilog agree at accepted Queue transfers.

gfsim execution is the first implementation gate. PYC/RTL obligations apply to the admitted lowering and remain explicit future work where provisional storage is rejected. Compile-only evidence does not establish behavior.

## Open decisions

- No additional item recorded; exact state/port review remains required.

## Contributor closure

- [ ] Claim the candidate and identify its parent/containing state owner.
- [ ] Resolve disposition; aliases and contained state must not duplicate hardware.
- [ ] Link the relevant NDF L0 intent and L1 behavior to this L2 implementation.
- [ ] Freeze port payload fields/widths, producer/consumer, parent seam, state/reset and timing profile.
- [ ] Define functional branches, all-or-none effects, contention and cancel/recovery lifecycle.
- [ ] Link a minimal failing gate for each actual framework/primitive gap and merge that shared fix first.
- [ ] Implement the accepted owner and design-local expected-result tests.
- [ ] Prove backpressure, identity/generation, exactly-once effects and isolated instances in gfsim.
- [ ] Integrate into H2/H1 and record admitted PYC/RTL evidence or remaining boundary.

## Source evidence

- `docs/specification/davincioo/ndf-next/interfaces/pycircuit-module-catalog.json:1` — Catalog row: BCTRL.BROB, source srcs/core/spe/bctrl/brob.py, status planned/deferred.
- `docs/specification/davincioo/ndf-next/scalar/bctrl.md:14` — Normative NDF owner/refinement clause.
- `docs/architecture/core/l3/SPE_EXECUTION_PACKETS.md:591` — Detailed proposed module card or disposition evidence.

Source paths use the frozen external repository spelling, including legacy `l3/` directories; they are provenance, not the new hierarchy vocabulary. File hashes and the original catalog disposition are in [catalog.json](../../catalog.json). See [architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for unresolved global decisions.

## CMT seam confirmed 2026-09-09

CMT sends the complete retained RobEvent independently of MPQ progress.
BROB must durably retain that transaction before returning a valid durable
BrobHandoffAck with matching EpochKey, InstKey, BlockKey and RobKey.
Recovery must preserve this already handed-off responsibility. This ack is
handoff acceptance, not proof of architectural publication. The existing
proposed HandoffReq boundary must be reconciled with this typed seam before
BROB implementation; the local CMT testbench models this promise only.
