# SPE.OOO.MPQ — Map Queue

- Source candidate: `DAV-SPE-OOO-MPQ-0001`
- Hardware hierarchy: **H3**, within H1 `SPE` / H2 `OOO`
- NDF refinement: **L2 microarchitecture**; module-specific L1 behavior links still require review.
- Recommended disposition: **leaf** (proposal, not registry approval)
- Proposed implementation path, if accepted as an independent leaf: `designs/davincioo/spe/ooo/mpq.py`
- Current design-program execution status: **not implemented**. External source evidence is recorded separately.

A typed NDF Queue contract exists and may have a Python design draft, but the catalog still says planned/deferred; promote only after behavioral and backend gates.

## Inputs

| Name | Payload/type | Meaning | Evidence status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rename_history | ScalarRenameHistory | REN history intent | declared |
| holder_acquire | MpqHolderAcquireRequest | S1-authorized lease transfer | declared |
| microcommit | RobEvent | CMT mapping handoff | declared |
| lease_update | MpqLeaseUpdateRequest | holder transfer/release | declared |
| mapping_release | MpqMappingRelease | displacement evidence | declared |
| abort_request | MpqAbortRequest | D3 compensation | declared |

## Outputs

| Name | Payload/type | Meaning | Evidence status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| history_ack | ScalarRenameHistory | durable assigned history | declared |
| holder_ack | MpqHolderAcquireAck | holder transfer result | declared |
| handoff_ack | MpqHandoffAck | oldest mapping acknowledgement | declared |
| lease_ack | MpqLeaseUpdateAck | lease update result | declared |
| mapping_ack | MpqMappingReleaseAck | displacement result | declared |
| abort_ack | MpqAbortAck | compensation result | declared |
| reclaim | MpqReclaimCandidate | zero-lease reclaim proof | declared |

Payload names in proposed rows are design pseudotypes until fields, widths and nominal identity are frozen. Queue transport is inferred by the compiler, not a requested public Queue wrapper. Clock/reset/time domain are execution context and must not be invented as ordinary payload ports.

## Owned or containing state

- ordered circular rename-history and lease ledger

## Required capabilities to verify

- typed compound Queue payloads
- atomic input/state/output rule semantics
- bounded Table/Array lowering with generation-qualified identity
- inferred persistent prepare/publish/compensate transaction lowering

These are requirements, not proof that the current framework is missing each one. First test the current revision; a demonstrated gap becomes a generic framework/primitive issue and regression before a dependent design PR.

## Behavioral acceptance

- All declared/proposed Queue outputs remain stable under backpressure and preserve full identity/generation.
- Stale, duplicate, wrong-flow, and post-recovery responses cause no mutation.
- gfsim and generated C++/Verilog agree at accepted Queue transfers.

gfsim execution is the first implementation gate. PYC/RTL obligations apply to the admitted lowering and remain explicit future work where provisional storage is rejected. Compile-only evidence does not establish behavior.

## Open decisions

- No additional item recorded; exact state/port review remains required.

## Contributor closure

- [ ] Claim the candidate and identify its parent/containing state owner.
- [ ] Resolve disposition; aliases and contained state must not duplicate hardware.
- [ ] Link the relevant NDF L0 intent and L1 behavior to this L2 implementation.
- [ ] Freeze port payload fields/widths, producer/consumer, parent seam, state/reset and timing profile.
- [ ] Define functional branches, all-or-none effects, contention and cancel/recovery lifecycle.
- [ ] Link a minimal failing gate for each actual framework/primitive gap and merge that shared fix first.
- [ ] Implement the accepted owner and design-local expected-result tests.
- [ ] Prove backpressure, identity/generation, exactly-once effects and isolated instances in gfsim.
- [ ] Integrate into H2/H1 and record admitted PYC/RTL evidence or remaining boundary.

## Source evidence

- `docs/specification/davincioo/ndf-next/interfaces/pycircuit-module-catalog.json:1` — Catalog row: OOO.MPQ, source srcs/core/spe/ooo/mpq.py, status planned/deferred.
- `docs/specification/davincioo/ndf-next/scalar/ooo.md:120` — Normative NDF owner/refinement clause.
- `docs/architecture/core/l3/SPE_EXECUTION_PACKETS.md:373` — Detailed proposed module card or disposition evidence.
- `docs/specification/davincioo/ndf-next/modules/spe/ooo/mpq.md:35` — Typed Queue/state contract for existing source draft.

Source paths use the frozen external repository spelling, including legacy `l3/` directories; they are provenance, not the new hierarchy vocabulary. File hashes and the original catalog disposition are in [catalog.json](../../catalog.json). See [architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for unresolved global decisions.

## CMT seam confirmed 2026-09-09

MPQ owns the REN-produced rename-history ledger. For each accepted CMT RobEvent,
it must find the complete matching EpochKey/InstKey/BlockKey/RobKey history set,
retain handoff responsibility, and return one valid, accepted, non-stale
MpqHandoffAck per distinct history_sequence with a valid durable history and
an unchanged request. CMT checks identity and distinct count, not a separately
supplied expected-ID set. Zero requested histories require no history ack.
This confirmation does not itself reclaim a physical register or publish an
architectural mapping. Recovery preserves accepted irreversible handoffs.
